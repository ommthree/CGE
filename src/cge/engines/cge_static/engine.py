"""Engine 3 — static computable general equilibrium (roadmap Phase 5).

Wraps the calibrated pilot CGE (``calibrate`` + ``model`` + ``solver``) behind the ``Engine``
protocol, so the GUI/CLI pick it up via the registry with no changes. Given a benchmark ``SAM``,
it calibrates the model to reproduce the base year exactly, applies a ``CarbonPrice`` as a
per-unit emissions cost wedge, solves for the new equilibrium, and emits a ``ResultSet`` of price
and volume changes plus GE outputs (factor prices, real GDP, welfare, carbon revenue). The CPI is
the numéraire, so there is no separate deflator/inflation output.

**Pilot scope (single region, one household):** the model is the small, correctness-first pilot
from `docs/phase-5-plan.md` §5.2a — Leontief intermediates, Cobb-Douglas value added and household
demand, CPI numéraire, with **revenue recycling** (lump_sum / labour_tax_cut). It passes benchmark
replication, homogeneity, Walras and the recycling-effect checks (the `cge_static` validation
suite). Armington trade and multiple regions are the next sub-phases; this engine is the provable
core, not yet the production model.

Data contract (``data`` dict): either a ``SAM`` supplied directly (validated: aligned, finite,
non-negative, balanced) with an optional per-sector dimensionless ``carbon_cost_share``, OR an
``IOSystem`` (+ ``SatelliteAccount``) — a real build — from which the SAM is built + quality-gated
and the carbon cost is derived the SAME way as Engine 1 (gases, coverage, and the 1e-6 M→currency
scaling). Emission provenance (satellite identity + effective cost-share hash) is recorded.
